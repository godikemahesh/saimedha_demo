  "00:00:01 - 00:01:02 hello everyone this is muhammad allah from the sai method institute koti hyderabad so in this video we are going to see the gunshot bits of the topic functions so in your eset syllabus of your mathematics we are having one unit which is differentiation and its applications so in that unit differentiation and its applications we are having the first topic it is related to functions and limits so from that functions and limits will be having some minimum of two marks okay from this topic functions and limits will be getting minimum two marks in the set examination so we are starting from the basic level what is the basic level actually the topic is functions okay after completing the gunshot bits of the functions we'll move on to the topic limits after functions then limits then we'll go for somewhat advanced level after limits we are going to see the gunshot bits related to 00:00:59 - 00:02:02 continuity continuity then after that differentiability okay so all these topics will be intelligent functions limits continuity and differentiability so we are going to the basics to the advanced level why we are discussing the questions of",
  "00:00:59 - 00:02:02 continuity continuity then after that differentiability okay so all these topics will be intelligent functions limits continuity and differentiability so we are going to the basics to the advanced level why we are discussing the questions of the continuity and differentiability means in the last year itself in the last year itself in the eset part the one question was there from the topic differentiability understood so we'll start from the functions part okay so if the question is asked from the functions top pick means it will be of minimum one marks so for that one marks let us see about some ten questions related to that part okay so these are the gunshot bits now what is the first question over here if f maps r to r is defined by f of x f of x is given function part over here which is equal to x square plus 3 x plus 2 then what we have to find we have to find f of x minus 1 this value we have to find okay so first what we are writing we are writing the function over here 00:01:59 - 00:03:00 so the function",
  "what we have to find we have to find f of x minus 1 this value we have to find okay so first what we are writing we are writing the function over here 00:01:59 - 00:03:00 so the function f of x f of x is equals to x square plus 3 x plus 2 we have taken is it here the function part we have written as it is now as we have to find the value of f of x minus 1 let us take one simple example if you are taking f of x what we are taking f of x it is equals to x plus 1 we have taken okay this is a simple example we are taking after discussing this example we go for the exact question over here okay so f of x is equals to x plus 1 we have taken now what you have to do means you have to find the value of f of 2 what you have to find you have to find the value of f of 2 f of 2 means what you are doing over here in the place of x you are writing",
  "find the value of f of 2 what you have to find you have to find the value of f of 2 f of 2 means what you are doing over here in the place of x you are writing 2 ok in the place of x what we are writing we are writing it is equals to 2 so in this part also in the place of x we have to write 2 so this can be written as 2 plus 1 which is equals to 3 so we are getting 00:02:57 - 00:03:58 the value of f of 2 which is equals to 3 understood so similarly what we have taken f of x it is equal to x square plus 3 x plus 2 the same function we have written over here now which value we have to find we have to find the value of f of x minus 1 so let us substitute over here f of f of x minus 1 which is equals to so if you have taken f of 2 means in the place of x so we have to write 2 yes or no then in this part also in",
  "f of f of x minus 1 which is equals to so if you have taken f of 2 means in the place of x so we have to write 2 yes or no then in this part also in the place of x what we are writing we are writing x minus 1 so in this part also in the place of x what we have tried we have to write x minus 1 okay so x square is now x square means we are writing it as x minus 1 whole square plus 3 into x minus 1 plus 2 which is equals now we have to simplify this part is it clear so x minus 1 whole square means as it is in the form of a minus b whole square a minus b whole square means what is the formula a 00:03:55 - 00:04:56 square plus b square minus 2 a b so let us write this part x square plus 1 square minus 2 a b means 2 into x into 1 which is 2 x okay now we are multiplying this part plus 3 into x means plus 3 x plus into minus minus",
  "this part x square plus 1 square minus 2 a b means 2 into x into 1 which is 2 x okay now we are multiplying this part plus 3 into x means plus 3 x plus into minus minus 3 3 plus 2 we have taken so which is equals to now this part x square will be as it is okay x square will be as it is now plus 3 x minus 2 x is there let us write now plus 3 x minus 2 x and what are the numbers over here plus 2 1 square means 1 itself plus 2 plus 1 means plus 3 plus 3 minus 3 so which is equals to x square 3x minus 2x means it will be plus x now plus 3 minus 3 gets cancelled so what we're getting the answer f of x minus 1 which is equals to x square plus 00:04:53 - 00:05:54 x now let us see the options over here x square plus x is given x square minus 3x plus 2 is given x square plus 2x x square minus x we have given the four options over here from these four",
  "let us see the options over here x square plus x is given x square minus 3x plus 2 is given x square plus 2x x square minus x we have given the four options over here from these four options we have to select the correct option so what we are getting the answer x square plus x so x square plus x means a first option is correct so this was a basic question similarly what we are going to see is we are going to see somewhat more questions of the advanced level so what you have to do you have to see the complete video and you have to practice by practicing itself you will get the marks and you will get the rank also by practicing itself as we got eight state first ranks in the last year okay in the year 2020 when we got a to stay to first ranks understood so what you have to do you have to see the video you have to see the video and all the questions the gunshot bits what are the gunshot bits according to the topic wise first we are going to discuss about",
  "you have to do you have to see the video you have to see the video and all the questions the gunshot bits what are the gunshot bits according to the topic wise first we are going to discuss about the functions then we'll go for the limits 00:05:52 - 00:06:52 also then continuity differentiability you have to practice compulsory okay if you if you are interested in taking the admissions in this imeda institute we are providing both online as well as offline coaching for the eset as well as semi institutions also first year second year and third year okay so if you want any more information you can contact shashikant valmiki sir and the contact numbers are given below now let us see the second question over here if f of x satisfies the functional equation x square into f of x plus f of 1 minus x equals to 2 x minus x power 4 is given okay what is the functional equation given over here x square into f of x plus f of 1 minus x equals to 2 x minus x power 4 then what we have to find actually we have to",
  "given okay what is the functional equation given over here x square into f of x plus f of 1 minus x equals to 2 x minus x power 4 then what we have to find actually we have to find the value of f of 1 by 2 what are the options given over here 1 by 2 3 by 4 1 by 4 and 3 by 2. now let us solve this part 00:06:49 - 00:07:53 so as it is given f of 1 by 2 means in the place of x what we have to take f of x is given f of 1 by 2 is given so in the place of x we are taking 1 by 2 and we have to substitute that x value over here in this functional equation so x square into f of x let us write as it is x square into f of x plus f of 1 minus x equals to 2 x minus x power 4 so let us substitute the x value over here 1 by 2 so 1 by 2 whole square into f of 1 by 2 plus f of 1 is as",
  "minus x equals to 2 x minus x power 4 so let us substitute the x value over here 1 by 2 so 1 by 2 whole square into f of 1 by 2 plus f of 1 is as it is 1 minus in the place of xo what we are writing we are writing it as 1 by 2 which is equals to 2 into again 1 by 2 minus 1 by 2 whole power 4 we have taken okay now let us do the simplification part simplification part means 1 by 2 whole square is it if you are giving the square for both numerator and the denominator it will 00:07:49 - 00:08:49 become 1 divided by 4 into f of 1 by 2 plus f of if you are taking the lcm over here 1 minus 1 by 2 what is the denominator 2 what is the numerator part 2 minus 1 which is equals to 1 okay now it is equals to this 2 2 gets cancelled the remaining part is 1 minus again if you are giving this power 4 power 4 for both numerator and the denominator 1 power 4 means it will",
  "1 okay now it is equals to this 2 2 gets cancelled the remaining part is 1 minus again if you are giving this power 4 power 4 for both numerator and the denominator 1 power 4 means it will be 1 only then 2 power 4 2 to the four four two sided twos are 16 so one divided by 16 we have taken understood now this part f of one by two we are having and here also f of 1 by 2 okay so what we can do means we can take f of 1 by 2 s common so if you are taking f of 1 by 2 s common means what is the remaining part over here the remaining part is 1 by 4 1 by 4 plus and in this part we are having 1 so which is equals to now if you are taking the lcm means this will be 16 and the numerator 00:08:47 - 00:09:16 part will be 16 minus 1 will be equals to 15 okay now we have to simplify this part so f of 1 by 2 f of 1 by 2 we have taken as it is",
  "numerator 00:08:47 - 00:09:16 part will be 16 minus 1 will be equals to 15 okay now we have to simplify this part so f of 1 by 2 f of 1 by 2 we have taken as it is f of 1 by 2 we have taken as it is now again in this part if you are taking the lcm is the denominator part will be 4 and the numerator part what will be the numerator part 1 plus 4 which is equals to 5 and it is equals to 15 divided by 16. 00:09:11 - 00:10:12 so in the question what we have to find actually we have to find the value of f of 1 by 2 so whenever we are finding f of 1 by 2 means this complete part this 5 by 4 part we have to send to the another side so what we can write f of 1 by 2 it is equals to 15 divided by 16 if you're sending 5 by 4 to the other side means it will become reciprocal so into four by five we have taken so phi ones are five threes are then four ones are",
  "equals to 15 divided by 16 if you're sending 5 by 4 to the other side means it will become reciprocal so into four by five we have taken so phi ones are five threes are then four ones are four fours are so finally what we're getting the answer f of one by two it is equals to three by four understood so what we got the answer f of 1 by 2 is equals to 3 by 4. let us see the options over here 1 by 2 3 by 4 1 by 4 and 3 by 2. so let us go with the option 2 which is equals to 3 by 4 understood all of you what we have done the functional equation was given x square into f of x plus f of 1 minus x equals to 2 x minus x power 4 is given so in this part what we have to 00:10:11 - 00:11:13 find actually we have to find the value of f of 1 by 2 f of x is given means in the place of x what we are writing 1 by 2 whenever we are substituting x is equal",
  "00:11:13 find actually we have to find the value of f of 1 by 2 f of x is given means in the place of x what we are writing 1 by 2 whenever we are substituting x is equal to 1 by 2 means what we are getting we are getting the answer as f of 1 by 2 it is equals to 3 by 4. so our second option will be correct now pause the video note it down okay now let us see our next question it is let fmap r2r be defined by f of x it is equals to f of x it is equals to x plus 2 when x is less than equals to minus 1 x square if minus 1 less than equals to x less than equals to 1 and f of x d equals to 2 minus x when x is greater than equals to 1 then what we have to find actually we have to find the value of f of minus 1.75 plus f of 0.5 plus f of 1.5 okay we have to find these values so what we have to do means we have to see",
  "to find actually we have to find the value of f of minus 1.75 plus f of 0.5 plus f of 1.5 okay we have to find these values so what we have to do means we have to see this 00:11:10 - 00:11:31 part okay so till now what we have done for in the first question and the second question we have taken the direct f of x part okay so in function we are substituting the x value so in this part also we have to do that only we have to substitute the x value which is minus one points uh 1.75 0.5 and 1. 00:11:25 - 00:12:26 5 but which function we have to take so in this part in this question we are having the conditions depending upon the conditions the function value is given understood so whenever the x value if you are taking less than equals to minus 1 means you have to take f of x it is equals to x plus 2 only you can't take x square and 2 minus 6 if x value it is lying between minus 1 and plus 1 means then f of x it",
  "to take f of x it is equals to x plus 2 only you can't take x square and 2 minus 6 if x value it is lying between minus 1 and plus 1 means then f of x it is equals to x square then x is greater than equals to 1 means then f of x it is equal to 2 minus x so depending upon this condition depending upon the x values we have to take the f of x value also understood so first we will find this part f of minus 1.75 so f of minus 1.75 means which function value we have to take which part we have to take means it is minus 1.75 minus 1.75 means it is x less than equals to minus 1 the first condition so 00:12:24 - 00:12:49 if you are taking this condition is the f of x part will be equals to x plus 2 we are taking so if you are taking f of x f of x equals to x plus 2 we have taken and the condition was x is less than equals to minus 1 okay now which value we are finding",
  "are taking so if you are taking f of x f of x equals to x plus 2 we have taken and the condition was x is less than equals to minus 1 okay now which value we are finding we are finding the value of f of minus 1. 00:12:43 - 00:13:11 75 so let us substitute over here f of minus 1.75 which is equals to so in the place of x what we are writing we are writing minus one point seven five so here also minus one point seven five plus two we have taken so which is equals to if you are simplifying this part means what we are getting the answer zero 0. 00:13:04 - 00:13:42 25 okay so this part f of minus 1.75 is equals to 0.25 then the next one f of 0.5 value we have to find so if you are finding f of 0.5 means actually that x value which is 0.5 it is lying between minus 1 to 1 so we have to take this part f of x it is equals to x square so if you are taking the second part as f of x it",
  "which is 0.5 it is lying between minus 1 to 1 so we have to take this part f of x it is equals to x square so if you are taking the second part as f of x it is equals to x square we have taken f of x equals x square means which value we have to find f of 0. 00:13:36 - 00:14:10 5 means in the place of x of what we have to substitute we have to substitute 0.5 whole square so which is equals to 0.5 whole square means 0.5 into 0.5 which is equals to 0.25 okay 0.25 so this part is also completed now what we have to do we have to find the value of f of 1.5 f of 1.5 means what we have to take the f of x value 1. 00:14:05 - 00:14:43 5 means it is greater than 1 if it is greater than 1 means f of x it is equals to 2 minus x so we have to take okay so f of x equals to 2 minus x we have taken so as we are finding the value of f of 1.5 so",
  "f of x it is equals to 2 minus x so we have to take okay so f of x equals to 2 minus x we have taken so as we are finding the value of f of 1.5 so f of 1.5 is equals to 2 minus 1.5 which is equals to 2 minus 1.5 means what we can write 0.5 so we got the three values f of minus 1.75 plus f of 0.5 plus f of 1. 00:14:36 - 00:15:13 5 also we got the three values now what we have to do we have to add these three values okay so therefore f of minus 1.75 plus f of 0.5 plus f of 1.5 which is equals to what is the first value 0.2 then second value 0.25 third value 0.5 so if you are adding these numbers if you are adding this numbers means what you are getting the answer 0.25 0. 00:15:07 - 00:16:08 25 means 0.5 0.5 plus zero point five means one point zero which is equals to one okay so what we're getting the final answer first we are finding this value which is equal to zero point two five then",
  "25 means 0.5 0.5 plus zero point five means one point zero which is equals to one okay so what we're getting the final answer first we are finding this value which is equal to zero point two five then second value zero point two five third value is equal to zero point five so we are having the plus sign if you are having the plus sign means we have to do plus if it is minus means then you have to do minus understood so after adding these three values we are getting the final answer which is equals to 1 so what are the options given over here 0 2 1 and -1 so let us go with the third option which is equals to 1. now let us see the next question it is if f of x equals to x minus 5 for x is less than equals to 1 4 x square minus 9 for 1 less than x less than 2 and a 3x plus 4 for x is greater than equals to 2 then what we have to find we have to find the value of f of 2 plus minus f",
  "for 1 less than x less than 2 and a 3x plus 4 for x is greater than equals to 2 then what we have to find we have to find the value of f of 2 plus minus f of 2 minus now what is the meaning of this f of 2 plus and what is 00:16:06 - 00:17:08 the meaning of f of two minus will discuss now okay so what are the function the conditions are given depending upon the x values depending upon the x values what we have to take we have to take the value of f of x also if x value it is less than equals to one means f of x is equals to x minus 5 if it is lying between 1 and 2 means f of x it is equal to 4 x square minus 9 if x valued is greater than equals to 2 means f of x it is equals to 3 x plus 4 so depending upon these conditions we have to find the value of f of 2 plus minus f of 2 minus what are the options 0 2 3 and 4. so first",
  "it is equals to 3 x plus 4 so depending upon these conditions we have to find the value of f of 2 plus minus f of 2 minus what are the options 0 2 3 and 4. so first we are finding the value of f of 2 plus okay so first we will find the value of f of 2 plus now what's the meaning of 2 plus over here okay 2 plus means 2 plus means it is somewhat greater than 2 plus means it can be any number it can 00:17:04 - 00:18:07 be any number 2 plus 0.1 2 plus 0.2 okay so 2 plus means what's the meaning of 2 plus it is somewhat greater than 2 understood it is somewhat greater than 2. so if x value it is greater than 2 then which part we have to take x is greater than equal to 2 means f of x value it is equals to 3 x plus 4 so we are taking this part f of x it is equals to 3 x plus 4 and what is the condition x is greater than equals to 2 so 2 plus means 2",
  "equals to 3 x plus 4 so we are taking this part f of x it is equals to 3 x plus 4 and what is the condition x is greater than equals to 2 so 2 plus means 2 plus what we are taking 2 plus means we are taking this condition this f of x value then after that what we have to substitute the x value x value you have to substitute 2 only x value you have to substitute 2 only but 2 plus means you are taking the condition over here which f of x value you have to take is it here so 2 plus means you have taken this condition you have taken this condition after taking this part you have to substitute x value as 2 only so 00:18:04 - 00:19:06 what we can write over here f of 2 plus which is equal so in the place of x what we are taking 3 into 2 plus 4 which is equals to three twos i mean six plus four which is equals to ten so the first value f of two plus value we are getting it as what it is",
  "are taking 3 into 2 plus 4 which is equals to three twos i mean six plus four which is equals to ten so the first value f of two plus value we are getting it as what it is equals to ten now let us find the second value second value means what it is f of 2 minus f of 2 minus now what is the meaning of 2 minus over here for 2 plus what we have taken it is somewhat greater than 2 now 2 minus means it is not minus 2 it is not minus 2 2 minus means it is somewhat less than 2 if it is somewhat less than 2 means which condition we have to take over here less than 2 means we are taking this part okay we are taking this part less than 2 because this first condition it is actually less than equals to 1 so 2 minus means what we are taking we are taking it is less than 2 somewhat less than 2 means we have to take the second 00:19:02 - 00:20:05 value f of x it is equals to f of x it is equals",
  "what we are taking we are taking it is less than 2 somewhat less than 2 means we have to take the second 00:19:02 - 00:20:05 value f of x it is equals to f of x it is equals to 4 x square minus 9 we have taken okay now after taking this condition 2 minus minus we have taken the condition after taking the condition which value we have to substitute x is equals to 2 only we have to substitute is it here so f of 2 minus which is equals to 4 into 2 square minus 9 which is equal to 2 square means 4 4 4s are 16 16 minus 9 which is equals to 7 okay so both values we got first value is equal to 10 second value it is equals to 7 so what is the value of f of 2 plus f of 2 plus value it is equals to 10 minus is there minus we have taken f of 2 minus value it is equals to 7 so which is equals to 3 what we are getting the answer which is equals to 3 what are the given options 0",
  "minus is there minus we have taken f of 2 minus value it is equals to 7 so which is equals to 3 what we are getting the answer which is equals to 3 what are the given options 0 2 3 and 4. so let us go with the third option f of 2 plus minus 00:20:01 - 00:21:03 f of 2 minus it is equals to 3 so if you are interested to take the admission in this imeda institute and uh taking the coaching for the eset as we are providing the eset coaching for the year 2022 as well as 2023 also okay so apart from this we are providing the semi institutions first year second year third year tuition institutions as well as eset coaching also understood so if you want any more information regarding this you can contact shashikant valmik kisar and the contact numbers are given below now for this question what we got the answer it is equals to 3. now pause the video note it down now let us see the next question over here it is if f of a equals log 1 minus a divided by 1 plus a",
  "got the answer it is equals to 3. now pause the video note it down now let us see the next question over here it is if f of a equals log 1 minus a divided by 1 plus a for 0 less than a less than 1 then f of 2a divided by 1 plus a square is given which value we have to find we have to find the value of f of 2a divided by 1 plus a square and what is 00:20:59 - 00:22:00 the question f of a f of a equals to log 1 minus a divided by 1 plus a so first let us write this part so f of a equals to log 1 minus a divided by 1 plus a we have taken okay this is a question and the value of we have to find this part f of 2a divided by 1 plus a square so f of 2 a divided by 1 plus a square now what is the meaning of this one whenever f of a value is given and we have to find the value of f of 2a divided by 1 plus a square so",
  "a divided by 1 plus a square now what is the meaning of this one whenever f of a value is given and we have to find the value of f of 2a divided by 1 plus a square so the meaning is in the place of a we have to write this complete part what we have to write in the place of a we have to write this complete part 2 a divided by 1 plus a square so this log part will be as it is log 1 minus in the place of a we are writing 2 a by 1 plus a square then whole 00:21:56 - 00:22:58 divided by 1 plus 2 a divided by 1 plus a square understood now which is equals to log part we have written as it is now in this part if you are taking the lcm over here so the denominator part will be 1 plus a square and the numerator part will be 1 plus a square minus 2a now next part again if you are taking the lcm means the denominator part will be 1 plus a square and what will be the numerator part 1",
  "and the numerator part will be 1 plus a square minus 2a now next part again if you are taking the lcm means the denominator part will be 1 plus a square and what will be the numerator part 1 plus a square plus 2a understood so now 1 plus a square 1 plus a square gets cancelled so what is the remaining part over here which is equals to log we have taken 1 plus a square minus 2 a divided by 1 plus a square plus 2 a we have taken understood now in this part 1 means we can write it as 1 square also in this also we can write it as 1 square also so whenever we are writing this part 1 square plus a square minus 2 a then 1 00:22:56 - 00:23:58 square plus a square plus 2a we are writing what we can do means it is in the form of a plus b whole square and a minus b whole square actually so for this part for this part we are writing it as 1 minus a whole square okay 1 minus a whole square because a minus b whole square",
  "plus b whole square and a minus b whole square actually so for this part for this part we are writing it as 1 minus a whole square okay 1 minus a whole square because a minus b whole square means a square plus b square minus 2 a b we have taken understood now for this part for this part what we can write we can write it is equals to 1 plus a 1 plus a whole square we are writing because it is in the form of a plus b whole square a plus b whole square means a square plus b square plus 2 a b okay so for numerator part we are writing it as 1 minus a whole square for denominator part we have to write it is 1 plus a whole square so which is equals to log 1 minus a whole square divided by 1 plus a whole square okay now in this complete part we are having the square for this 00:23:56 - 00:24:57 part also for the denominator part also we are having the square so what we can do means log apart we are writing as it is now",
  "this complete part we are having the square for this 00:23:56 - 00:24:57 part also for the denominator part also we are having the square so what we can do means log apart we are writing as it is now in this part 1 minus a divided by 1 plus a we are writing it as whole square okay what we have taken we have taken it as whole square now whenever we are having the square part ah according to the properties of the logarithm what we can write which is equals to 2 log we are writing it as 2 log 1 minus a divided by 1 plus a so we are getting the answer as this part okay 2 log 1 minus a divided by 1 plus a now let us see the options over here f of a is given 2 into f of s given 1 by 2 into f of a minus f of a is given but we are not getting this answer 2 into log 1 minus a divided by 1 plus a let us see the question over here if you are comparing with the question what is this part log",

  "taking f of 2a divided by 1 plus a square means what we are getting the answer 2 into f of a now let us see the options so in this options f of a 2 into f of a 1 by 2 into f of a minus f of a means we are getting the answer as 2 into f of a so our option 2 will be correct now pause the video write it down now our next question is if f map a to r is defined as f of x equals to x cube plus 1 is given x cube plus 1 and a is equals to 1 2 minus 1 minus 2 0 is given the a values then what we have to find 00:25:53 - 00:26:54 we have to find the range of the function range of f means we have to find the range of the function so we have given the options over here 0 1 2 7 9 minus 7 0 1 to 9 minus 9 0 1 to 7 minus 1 0 1 2 9 okay so by taking that a values we have to find the range over here",
  "over here 0 1 2 7 9 minus 7 0 1 to 9 minus 9 0 1 to 7 minus 1 0 1 2 9 okay so by taking that a values we have to find the range over here okay so let us write the function f of x f of x equals to x cube plus one we have taken so whenever we are taking this part f of x means first what we are substituting one value we have to substitute 1 so f of f of 1 is equals to f of 1 means what we are doing in the place of x so we have tried 1 that's it in the place of x we have to write 1 so 1 cube 1 cube plus 1 which is equals 1 plus 1 it is equals to 2. now next part same function f of x it is equals to x cube plus 1 we have taken then the next 00:26:51 - 00:27:52 value is f of 2 in the place of x so what we have to write it is equals to 2 so this part will be 2 cube plus 1 which is equals",
  "taken then the next 00:26:51 - 00:27:52 value is f of 2 in the place of x so what we have to write it is equals to 2 so this part will be 2 cube plus 1 which is equals to 2 cube into 2 4 photos are 8 then 8 plus 1 which is equals to 9 okay so we are getting the second value it is equals to 9 now next part f of x it is equals to x cube plus 1 we have taken which is equals to now in the place of x so what we have to write we have to write minus 1 so minus 1 whole cube plus 1 which is equal to minus 1 whole cube means what we're getting the answer minus 1 plus 1 which is equals to 0 okay next next value is minus 2 we have to take so f of x f of x it is equals to x cube plus 1 we have taken in the place of x minus 2 whole cube plus 1 which is equals to minus 2 whole cube means what we can write minus 3 times means it will be",
  "equals to x cube plus 1 we have taken in the place of x minus 2 whole cube plus 1 which is equals to minus 2 whole cube means what we can write minus 3 times means it will be minus only if you are taking two cube means it will be eight 00:27:50 - 00:28:52 so minus eight plus one which is equals to minus seven okay now the last value what it is f of x f of x it is equals to x cube plus one which is equals to what we have to find now f of 0 f of 0 means in the place of x what we have to write we have to write 0 so 0 cube plus 1 which is equals to 1 so we have got all the values over here so what we can write therefore range what we are getting the range range is equals to we are getting the answers we are getting the answers as 2 9 0 minus 7 and 1 so let us write as it is so 2 we are getting 9 0 minus 7 and 1 is it here so how we can",
  "the answers we are getting the answers as 2 9 0 minus 7 and 1 so let us write as it is so 2 we are getting 9 0 minus 7 and 1 is it here so how we can rearrange this part means it is minus 7 minus 7 0 1 2 and nine if you are seeing all the options over here so what we are getting the answer says so minus seven zero one 00:28:49 - 00:29:50 two nine so we are rearranging this part so as per our our answer so this option two will be correct understood now pause the video note it down now our next question is if f of x equals to a power 2 x minus a power minus 2 x divided by a power 2 x plus a power minus 2 x then f of x is what we have to find f of x is even function or odd function okay so we are having some conditions related to even function and odd function what is that condition a function is said to be even a function is said to be even what is the condition for that part",
  "function okay so we are having some conditions related to even function and odd function what is that condition a function is said to be even a function is said to be even what is the condition for that part means if f of minus x it is equals to f of x okay so what is the condition for even function f of minus x it is equals to f of x now what is the second condition second means odd function if you are taking odd function means what is the 00:29:48 - 00:30:50 condition for odd function f of minus x it is equals to minus of f of x so these are the two conditions related to even function and odd function let us take simple example what we are taking means suppose we are taking f of x f of x it is equals to we have taken x square plus 1 we have taken what we have taken x square plus 1 now what we have to do we have to find f of minus x value for both even function and order function in the place of x so what we have to",
  "what we have taken x square plus 1 now what we have to do we have to find f of minus x value for both even function and order function in the place of x so what we have to write we have to write minus x in the place of x we are writing minus x so this can be written as minus x whole square plus 1 we have taken minus x whole square plus 1 so which is equals to minus x whole square means it will be x square plus 1 so whenever we are substituting the x value as minus x we are getting the same answer if you are getting the same answer means what we can write instead of x square plus 1 we can write it as f 00:30:48 - 00:31:48 of x itself so we are getting the answer as f of minus x it is equals to f of x so whenever we are getting this condition if this part it is satisfying means we can call this function as even function understood what we can call we can call the function as even function now if you are taking",
  "so whenever we are getting this condition if this part it is satisfying means we can call this function as even function understood what we can call we can call the function as even function now if you are taking some another example what is that f of x f of x it is equals to we are taking x cube plus x we have taken f of x it is equals to x cube plus x we have taken again what we have to find we have to find the value of f of minus x f of minus x means in the place of x what we have to write minus x so this can be written as minus x whole cube plus again in the place of x we are writing it as minus x which is equals to so minus x whole cube means what we are writing so this will be minus x cube only plus into minus minus x which is equals to now what we are doing means if 00:31:46 - 00:32:48 you are taking minus as common if you are taking minus as common means this can be written as x cube",
  "plus into minus minus x which is equals to now what we are doing means if 00:31:46 - 00:32:48 you are taking minus as common if you are taking minus as common means this can be written as x cube plus x okay what we are doing we are taking minus s common so that can be written as x cube plus x which is equals to minus this is f of minus x it is equals to minus we have written as same then instead of x cube plus x what we can write it is equals to f of x so we have taken f of x over here okay so whenever f of minus x value it is equals to minus of f of x we are calling this part as odd function if f of minus x it is equals to f of x we are calling it as even function understood so this was a simple example related to how to find whether the function is even or odd now let us see our same question oh yeah f of x is equal to a power to x minus a power minus 2 x divided",

  "getting the output values that output values it is lying between minus 1 and plus 1 itself ok minus 1 and plus 1 itself understood so whenever we are taking that part the input values means we are calling it as a domain so whenever we are taking all the input 00:51:18 - 00:52:20 values the output values what we are getting that range part it is lying between minus one to plus one itself so that's why we have taken the range of sine x it is equals to minus one to one similarly for cos x also it will be say minus one to one so how we are representing this part the range of sine x means we are representing it as a minus 1 less than equals to sine x less than equals to 1 now what we have to do means first we are writing this part so which is minus 1 less than equals to sine x less than equals to 1 we have taken okay now what is the question over here 1 divided by 5 minus sine 2x is here means in this part we have taken sine x but according to",
  "to sine x less than equals to 1 we have taken okay now what is the question over here 1 divided by 5 minus sine 2x is here means in this part we have taken sine x but according to our question we are having sine 2 x okay sine 2x so just now what we have discussed if you are taking any value if you are taking any value of x means we are getting the same range which is minus 1 to 1 itself so if you are substituting x value over here any value then if you are multiplying with 2 means what will get the answer the answer the 00:52:18 - 00:53:18 output value will be lying between minus 1 to plus 1 itself so that's why we are writing it as minus 1 less than equals to sine 2x we have taken less than equals to 1. so if you are taking sine 2x sine 3x sine phi x sine 7x sine 9x also the range will be same minus 1 to plus 1 okay now what we have to do means after this part this step by step slowly slowly we have to convert",
  "3x sine phi x sine 7x sine 9x also the range will be same minus 1 to plus 1 okay now what we have to do means after this part this step by step slowly slowly we have to convert this part into our question okay what we have to do we have to convert this part into our question now sine 2x we have achieved over here then after that we are having the minus for sine 2x so whenever we are multiplying with the minus sign if you are multiplying with the minus signs means this symbol will be changed less than part will become greater than and this minus into minus will become plus 1 understood this part will become plus 1 this part is greater than equal to this part will become minus sine 2x greater than equals to minus 1 okay so up to here we have 00:53:16 - 00:54:17 completed minus sine 2x part we have completed now what else we are having in the denominator part we are having plus 5 so plus 5 means what we have to do we have to add a 5 for this one okay so whenever we",
  "we have completed now what else we are having in the denominator part we are having plus 5 so plus 5 means what we have to do we have to add a 5 for this one okay so whenever we are adding plus 5 means 1 plus 5 it is equals to 6 greater than equals 2 then this will be 5 minus sine 2 x greater than equals to minus 1 plus 5 which is equals to 4 understood we have taken this part now after this we are having the numerator also 1 divided by we have to do the reciprocal of this part so whenever we are performing this one means again it will be this this part will become 1 by 6 and the symbols will be changed less than equals to this part will become 1 divided by 5 minus sine 2 x less than equals to 1 by 4 is it clear so what we're getting the answer is 1 divided by 5 minus sine 2 x so slowly by sine x we have converted this sine x into our question which is 1 divided by 5 minus sine 2x now what will be",
  "we're getting the answer is 1 divided by 5 minus sine 2 x so slowly by sine x we have converted this sine x into our question which is 1 divided by 5 minus sine 2x now what will be the 00:54:15 - 00:55:15 range over here the range will be minimum value and maximum value means the extreme values we have to take what is the values over here at the first we are having one by six then at the last we are having one by four so one by six and one by four will be our range now let us see the options over here one by six comma one by four all in all the options the values are same one by six uh comma 1 by 4 but we are having we can observe that the brackets are different okay now in some part it is using the round bracket and in some parts it is using the square bracket now what is the meaning of round bracket and square bracket over here suppose if you are using if you are using the round brackets if you are using the round brackets means it",
  "it is using the square bracket now what is the meaning of round bracket and square bracket over here suppose if you are using if you are using the round brackets if you are using the round brackets means it is excluding part okay it is excluding part if you are using the round bracket now if you are using this square bracket if you are using the square bracket means the meaning is 00:55:13 - 00:56:14 including what the meaning over here including so if you are using the round bracket means it means excluding if you're using the square bracket miss it is the meaning is including so in this part whenever we are having equal to part if you are having equal to part means it is including if it was not equal to if it was not equal to means then it is coming under excluding for excluding what we have to write we have to use the round bracket for including whenever we are having the equal to part less than equal to zero if you are having equal to means then we have to go for including if it is including means for both",
